# mac-app-installation
 Macos app installation via brew


This is a short script that uses an online hosted json file with various brew cask names and asks the user what to install. 

I have added some input validation and checks for prerequisites. 

I had plans to adapt it for multiple apps and try to incorporate it as a package in Jamf Pro with the use of the script GUI tools that Jamf offers. The company went a different direction so my plans were scrapped. 

Maybe in the future I'll pick it up again but for now I don't plan to add any new code. 
feel free to grab it and mod to your needs.
